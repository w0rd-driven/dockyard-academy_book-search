Book Search is a demonstration project for [DockYard Academy](https://github.com/DockYard-Academy/beta_curriculum).

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`
  * Run tests with `mix test`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
