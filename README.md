# BookSearch

Book Search is a demonstration project for [DockYard Academy](https://github.com/DockYard-Academy/beta_curriculum).

To start your Phoenix server:

* Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
* Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`
* Run tests with `mix test`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Reference Material

This is an app that primarily showcases deployment via Fly.io for time constraints.
Normally, I would create a reference application from scratch but we're pressed for time in the beta cohort.

There are unique commits that highlight changes but I would never commit such a large payload for the first commit.
As I go through the material again I plan on adding unique branches for each step covered. I wanted the first
iteration to work through the full reference material to fully understand how everything fits together.
Now I can deviate by replacing this repository with the full history in the future.

I didn't want to mislead anyone by thinking this was mine from start to finish, but everything I work on builds on
this muscle memory even if I'm working through making 1:1 changes.
